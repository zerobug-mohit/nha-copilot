"""Weekly report data service (ABDM).

Runs a fixed set of read-only aggregate queries over the ABDM tables for a date
range and returns a structured report payload covering digital-adoption activity:
ABHA creation, facility & professional registration, health-record linking, and
Scan & Share / Scan & Pay transactions — with week-over-week change, geography
and ownership breakdowns, and bridge/integrator status. Deterministic SQL — the
LLM only writes the executive summary.
